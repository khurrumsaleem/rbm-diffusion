# Unit Testing

Here is a guide of how to add unit tests and the structure of the `tests` directory. A detailed example of what a testing file should look like is provided in `tests/example.cpp` and `tests/CMakeLists.cpp`.

## Structure

Each file in `src` should have a corresponding testing file titled `test_src-file-name.cpp` where `src-file-name` is the name of the source file.

## Test File Specifics

The unit tests will use the functions and macros defined in the `unit_test_framework.hpp` file. In each testing file this should be included as well as any of the dependencies required such as the corresponding file that is being tested. Each unit test is defined using the `TEST` macro with the corresponding unit test name. For example:
```cpp
TEST(test_name) {
  // Place test here
}
```
After all the unit tests are defined the file is finished with `TEST_MAIN();`.

This framework provides several assertion functions to use within each unit test:

- `ASSERT_EQUAL(first, second)`: Passes if `first == second`
- `ASSERT_NOT_EQUAL(first, second)`: Passes if `first != second`
- `ASSERT_ALMOST_EQUAL(first, second, precision)`: Passes if `first` is within `precision` of `second`
- `ASSERT_SEQUENCE_EQUAL(first, second)`: Passes if all values in `first` equal those in `second` (they could be arrays or vectors)
- `ASSERT_FALSE(value)`: Passes if `value` is false
- `ASSERT_TRUE(value)`: Passes if `value` is true

## Running with CMake

Prior to compiling add the test file name to the `tests/CMakeLists.txt` file. Then the project can be compiled and the tests can be ran using `make test` or `ctest`.
